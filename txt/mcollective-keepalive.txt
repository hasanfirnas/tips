mcollective - keepalive
=======================

Useful for :

* nodes behind firewalls closing connections after a while
* brokers in failover mode behind a vIP
* ...

When they send nothing, the nodes don't see that the link in down. They don't reconnect.

Recent versions of MCollective have a TCP keep alive, but this only kicks in after 2 hours of idle.

Solution : deploy the following settings on all nodes.

In `/etc/mcollective/server.cfg` :

[source, ini]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Registration (can be used for keepalive)
registerinterval = 300
registration = Keepalive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In `/usr/libexec/mcollective/mcollective/registration/keepalive.rb` :

[source, ruby]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
module MCollective
    module Registration
        class Keepalive<Base
            def body
                'I am alive'
            end
        end
    end
end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
